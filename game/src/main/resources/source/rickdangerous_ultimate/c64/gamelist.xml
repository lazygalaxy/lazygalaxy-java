You play a park ranger, whose job is to collect twelve items scattered around the park, such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in later levels.</desc>

Between the four characters (all of which you control), you can destroy the dumbifying devices and save the earth. Not too bad for a tabloid reporter.</desc>

Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.</desc>

You must pilot your craft through some of the hardest levels ever created and shoot down all the enemy space craft and ground weapons, and avoid the many indestructible hazards. The innovation is that you do not simply travel in a single direction, but instead move from left to right or right to left depending on where the current targets are, in a manner more similar to Defender than most shoot 'em ups.</desc>

Two types of enemy run onto the pipe - those that can make a hole (commonly drills, a blowtorch and the earthenware jug) and pests (spiders, lobsters and so on). Once a hole is made in the pipe, the foreman must guide a (green-suited) workman to the hole so it can be repaired.

An obscure title that I always loved - and the very odd graphics and gameplay, on a 2D surface where you're always flying everywhere, were so strange, but in the end that made it a memorable game.</desc>

As Jose travels, flight patterns of he and the bullet-shaped spaceships he must avoid are created and as they pass through the trails that are created, and as the moonjuice spreads and smears, the musical score is modified according to a generative algorithm.</desc>

		<desc>Dam Busters is an early flight simulation, set in World War II. It focuses on Dam Busters who historically were used to heavily bombard strategic objectives, in this case dams. This task is not easy, as en route you will face heavy opposition forces. Fortunately, you won't be a sitting bomber in the air. Your aircraft is equipped with machine guns (left and right) with unlimited rounds of fire power, so fire at will as the enemy approaches. When the time comes, you will have to bomb the target manually. So, get ready to unload the cargo and give them hell!</desc>

		<desc>Madness is a platformer that features 30 screen sized levels. The goal of each levels is to reach the exit within the time limit. The catch is, that the exit needs to be activated by lighting all torches that are spread throughout a level. Naturally, there are lots of different obstacles and enemies trying to stop the player. Most enemies follow a set path, however some may chase the player's sprite through the entire stage. As the levels become more complex, it is necessary to work out routes that don't end in a dead end and allow the player to reach the exit in time while still avoiding enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Saboteur! combines platform, beat 'em up and adventure elements, setting you as a lone samurai trying to infiltrate an enemy complex. You are capable of all manner of ninja-style moves including kicks and punches, as well as using weaponry. You must travel through an underground complex linked mainly by platforms and ladders, before triggering a bomb and escaping the complex. Your energy recharges if you stay still, so finding areas free of guards (kill these for money) and dogs (avoid them; killing them gains you nothing) is useful, especially as you only have one life. There's plenty of object manipulation involved, although only one item can ever be carried at a time.</desc>

The game is viewed isometrically, which means that the controls are rotated through 90 degrees - this, coupled with the fact that many screens have huge gaps and diagonal paths, means that it's hard to get far at first. Falling off ledges loses you time, which is very limited to start with.</desc>

There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring).</desc>

Four different teams participate in the contest: Houston, Tokyo, Moscow and Madrid. Each team consists of five players on skates and a ball is shot into an arena from right to left and the idea is to pick the ball up and shoot it into an opening in the wall on the right. If the ball touches the left wall then the game is restarted and the ball fired into the arena again. Each match lasts 10 mins and the team with the most goals win. The ball can only be picked up and if touched knocks the player off his feet and the player with the ball can be tackled by the opposition players.</desc>

Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles.) At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!).</desc>

Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example).</desc>

The game requires you to "draft" a team before play, composing the best possible squad based on each player's skill attributes. The game also allows a semblance of managerial control, and has an optional batting practice mode to warm up. It then allows you to play individual games, or participate in a 4 division, 24-team championship.</desc>

Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.</desc>

The goal is to colour 75% of the playfield; everything above gives bonus points for the high score list. Well, it is not that easy. White pixels fly around the field and touching them result in death; similarly deadly is going backwards on a line.</desc>

The most noticable change is that the player no longer has to wait for 'Land now' to flash on screen before he's actually allowed to land. So once you reach the landing strip, you can land (although it might not be the wisest choice to do so, because less kills means less points and thus less precious extra lives). For some reason, that message still appears after some time, but it's without any function.</desc>

You do this by flying a plane over a limited area, and shooting his planes so that they fall and inflict damage on the target item, which is large at the bottom of the screen. Multiple shots on a particular spot will ultimately cause a water-spout; three waterspouts and the ship (or island) will sink.</desc>

The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation. The screens are linked in various ways, and contain a number of keys which must be used correctly.</desc>

Based on the fantasy film Labyrinth, it tasks the player with navigating a maze while solving puzzles and evading dangers. The player's goal is to find and defeat the main antagonist, Jareth, within 13 real-time hours. Unlike other adventure games of the period, Labyrinth does not feature a command-line interface. Instead, the player uses two scrolling "word wheel" menus on the screen to construct basic sentences.</desc>

Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.</desc>

A civil war between two factions, the Palyars (indigenous "good guys") and the Mechanoids (invading "bad guys"), affords the player an opportunity to earn money to buy their escape from Targ. For instance, each faction seeks the destruction of installations belonging to its rival, and the capture of material or other resources to support their cause.</desc>

In essence Parallax is a top-view multi-directional-scrolling shoot 'em up. Improved weaponry and shield recharges can be bought by the machine - can you think of a way to get money from a drugged scientist? You can duck under the layers of surface, but so can the aliens, so action can take place here.</desc>

These plays included a great number of offensive strategies, including draws, curls, sweeps and long bombs, among others. Defensive tactics equally were varied, with the player being able to choose a defensive formation based on what they thought the opponent would attempt.</desc>

These include a turbo-jump (allowing the car to get airborne unassisted, rather than relying on jumps) and waterproofing. The original Commodore 64 version was programmed by Jeroen Leijten, with music by Theo and Renier Hongens. It was largely inspired by previous arcade games Steer and Go and Spy Hunter.</desc>

There are six tracks in the game, complete with stunts and wheelies that the player must accomplish in order to proceed onto the next track. Riding the bike causes energy to be lost, but soda cans can be collected to replenish it. Also, doing stunts causes the player to crash down hard, losing spokes (wheels). Replacement spokes, like the soda cans, can be collected along the way. The game ends when the player does not qualify, runs out of time, or has no spokes left.</desc>

Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score. There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</desc>

		<desc>California Games was the original "Extreme Games" – what today's generation might call "X-Games in the sun". Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX. The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine. The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.</desc>

That means trekking halfway around the world, armed only with an infinite supply of peanuts and a handful of bombs (fortunately more can be collected as you go along). You start with nine lives, but the game's design is such that a lot of deaths will be unexpected, so prior knowledge of the layouts is essential to get through most sections of the five levels without losing lives. The two-player mode involves the screen following the lead player, so the latter can lose lives by getting too far behind. With lots of precise jumps across vertically-progressing ledges involved, a lot of skill and timing is required.</desc>

Floating besides them in the water is an old apple barrel, so jumping in they start a journey down the rapids looking for safety. As they float down the river, Dizzy must avoid various other creatures and obstacles as touching them will lose one of three lives. There are also dragons firing cannons on bridges and mini hurricanes which send Dizzy in another direction. Dizzy can throw apples at the creatures but these are limited but are replenished after dying.</desc>

		<desc>Dizzy's third adventure sees the introduction of the Yolkfolk, including Daisy, who has got lost in the fantasy world of the title. Dizzy sets off to rescue her, braving dragons, rats and alligators along the way. The lands are littered with coins, and as well as completing the main task you should aim to collect as many of these as possible. There are puzzles on most screens, involving collecting objects such as keys, food and water buckets, and using them on doors, flames and such. Unlike the first two game, dialogue boxes between Dizzy and various other characters are included, giving the game a sense of character and humor as well as guiding you through the puzzles somewhat.</desc>

The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.</desc>

		<desc>I could hardly belive it at first, but there before my very eyes was the key I had been searching for. The Eye of Osoris, yet there was something strange and unfamiliar about the symbol, something I had never seen in my travels throughout Egypt. It was as though the Eye had been here many thousands of years, before both the Sphinx under which it was positioned, and the great Pyramids ever existed. As I intensely examined the Eye, it became clear that it was not made of an Earthly substance and therefore confirmed my theory of its extra-terrestial origins. Whilst I pondered over my astounding find, I suddenly became aware of a low pitched humming sound which appeared to come from beneath the vey ground.</desc>

		<desc>Sury Ani 7 has been a source of mined resources for many a year, but now that it is contaminated, the only way to harvest its bounty is to do so remotely. Worse still, the security system of defence droids is active, and primed to damage anything which attempts to penetrate the surface. As such, you are in control of a Dedicated Disposal Droid in, which must eventually shut down the security system and clear the area of radioactive material. This is done by throwing it down the disposal chute on each of the 8 levels, but you only have limited time before they explode. Fuel is limited and must be found within the complex, with the retro-thrust move using it up particularly quickly.</desc>

These aren't average bugs; Chicago is under siege from mutated insects, rats and even toy tanks. You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.</desc>

Viewed isometrically, Isvar's adventure features complex object manipulation: each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. The castle is guarded and full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - food and wine can restore it.</desc>

A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies' position. Fuel and rockets are limited, but there are several landing platforms where the jet can be refueled and resupplied. Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them. As the game progresses, enemies attack in increasingly large and difficult waves.</desc>

These objects include getting keys that will open yellow doors, and explosives that will detonate walls.

Players can be bought or sold, with their transfer values varying according to the size of any bid.

You can take out a loan, limited depending on your division, while day-to-day bills must be covered. Matches feature short animated highlights sequences of key moments.</desc>

However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle parapets by an invincible knight in full armour. Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously!.</desc>

If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return. Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do. When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance. This is the real challenge of any tennis game.</desc>

Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too.</desc>

These vary between open and shut - the open ones offer more points, and an extra life is on offer for collecting 10 in a row, so if possible the route should take in the open ones in order. Gameplay differs from the original, in that Bombjack's movement is no longer free and self-propelled. Instead, he moves flick-style between ledges, so long as one is directly within one of the 4 compass directions. Baddies can be pushed off ledges, but this uses up some of Jack's limited energy.</desc>

These can be moved, in the manner of sliding puzzles, where there is only one gap, and tiles can be moved into the gap, creating a new gap. The aim is then to move the tiles so the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb. There is a time limit, however, and extra time is knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end. Also some levels contain water droplets, that extinguish the spark if they touch it.</desc>

		<desc>The game starts where Dan lands his airship on the top of the evil Dr Blitzen's hideout. The aim of the game is to find eight sticks of dynamite that are placed randomly around the playing area whilst avoiding the perils of the game such as moving monsters, drowning and falling from great heights. Once Dan has all eight sticks of dynamite, the player must make their way to the central safe to blow it open and steal the plans for the evil doctor's Death Ray and escape to his airship. The playing area is essentially one large building split up into multiple screens that wrap around a central elevator. Each screen contains a number of moving monsters that, once the player moves into them, are destroyed but take off a life in return.</desc>

		<desc>Playing a thoroughly drab, mundane and predictable character, your aim is to become interesting enough to reach the Pleasuredome. After discovering a gruesome murder, your interest in something greater than the routine of 80s Liverpool is awoken. You explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.</desc>

The game consists of 6 levels, on which you must obtain treasures and - of course - a map that allows you to leave the labyrinthine pyramid alive. You must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.</desc>

		<desc>In this tennis game, the focus is on timing and directing your shots accurately, as the computer moves your player into position. The positive result of this is that you can (and to win must) play angled volleys and precisely-placed lob and drop shots. The gameplay is thus more tactical than many tennis games; choosing the move to outfox your opponent comes into play. 1 or 2 player, 3 or 5 set matches can be played, or asphalt, clay or grass. The four computer players are inspired by Jimmy Conners, Björn Borg, John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl. Court layout and service rules are accurate. The AI player watches your playing style and can step up a gear in quality if it needs to.</desc>

The economy functions on fines rather than taxes, making for a plethora of petty rules and no penal punishment. Robot employees make everything run cheaply. Body part reselling allows hospitals to turn a profit. Robots can even control human reproduction. The end result is a society in which humans have no useful role.

The game is viewed slightly top-down, with indoor rooms bordered by line drawn vectors rather than the fuller jungle graphics. The pace of the game is quite fast, and the challenge of the action elements is increased by not having infinite weaponry. The route through the game is non-linear, with multiple exits and secret rooms commonplace.</desc>
