As you upgrade, your insect turns into a more powerful bat or a mighty dragon. Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level.</desc>

This was one of the first games to feature video-style replays, allowing you to find the exact moment you want to replay, from any part of the race, and view it at normal speed, double-speed, or freeze-frame. The camera angles on offer here include one that follows the bike, one that views the track from the side, and a TV-style chase view.</desc>

Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.</desc>

The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. You return fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves your character, so be careful not to run into a bullet.</desc>

		<desc>My Story...Fifty years ago, my Grandfather, a brave and bold warrior, defeated a powerful force of space pirates to secure a new world for the human race, who were fleeing from the now dead Earth. The past five decades of life on the Ring-Worlds of Triton have altered the life of the Human Race. Man is no longer a warrior; his technological advancement has bred a new fighter. Robot pilots now defend his new home. With no concept of fear and reactions a little slower than the speed of light, they are the formidable force which has prevented reprisals from the pirates; until now.</desc>

The goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on.</desc>

		<desc>As a highly respected warrior, you are attempting to conquer as many regions as possible. This is a three-stage task, as first you must fight through hordes of fighters simply to reach the castle, and then you have to climb the various sections of the castle, before battling with its existing inhabitant. The bulk of the game is side-scrolling platform hack 'n' slash action, with mines to avoid on the route. You can collect a number of spells, and select them using the function keys. Your physical and mental energy are measured separately throughout the game, and must both be kept high.</desc>

In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them. The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>After personalizing your character, you enter the game where everyone is a suspect. The murder has occurred and whoever did it is nicely camouflaged within the party crowd in the house. However, the time is crucial as you have limited time (2 hours or so) to solve the mystery and make an arrest. With skills at your disposal, you will be able to take fingerprints from almost anything, write in your detective notebook about conversations you find intriguing, and slowly but surely, outlining your suspect. Alas, many love affairs, plots, intrigues and what all not among other characters may be uncovered in your investigations, but that mustn't cloud your judgment for why you are here, to solve the Murder!</desc>

		<desc>Projectyle is a single or multiplayer (1 to 3 players) hockey-type sports game of the future. It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music. A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels. The camera smoothly follows the puck/ball (the "projectyle") and scrolls to the adjacent rooms when entering one of the connecting tunnels. Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.</desc>

Each level is comprised of nine sectors, which are not all linked together. At the beginning of each level you drop in from above and get a general overview of the level. Planning a path from sector to sector often involves using moving pathways. The sectors are heavily defended, but weapons can be picked up throughout. When a sector is cleared of robots, the screen flashes and the player is free to move on to the next sector.</desc>

		<desc>In Skidz, the player moves through the five levels with the goal to collect and dispose of all litter lying around. To be more exact, 75% of the litter has to be collected and put into dust bags on the way to get access to the next level. However, not all litter is in easy to reach positions and has to be collected with tricky jumps. The controls work in a way that the player builds up the speed by pressing a button or pulling the joystick in a direction. If high speed is reached, another press of the button results in a jump.</desc>

		<desc>A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists? Starflight is a space exploration game.</desc>
