As you upgrade, your insect turns into a more powerful bat or a mighty dragon. Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level.</desc>

This was one of the first games to feature video-style replays, allowing you to find the exact moment you want to replay, from any part of the race, and view it at normal speed, double-speed, or freeze-frame. The camera angles on offer here include one that follows the bike, one that views the track from the side, and a TV-style chase view.</desc>

		<desc>My Story...Fifty years ago, my Grandfather, a brave and bold warrior, defeated a powerful force of space pirates to secure a new world for the human race, who were fleeing from the now dead Earth. The past five decades of life on the Ring-Worlds of Triton have altered the life of the Human Race. Man is no longer a warrior; his technological advancement has bred a new fighter. Robot pilots now defend his new home. With no concept of fear and reactions a little slower than the speed of light, they are the formidable force which has prevented reprisals from the pirates; until now.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>
