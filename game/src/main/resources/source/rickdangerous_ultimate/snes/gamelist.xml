The players first controls a prehistoric sea organism, and fights to gain evolution points with which he can improve his fish's body parts and upgrade his attack/defense abilities. The gameplay is not completely linear, which means that certain choices of paths and stages will affect the player's success. The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature. The physical changes are fairly scientifically accurate which gives the game a semi-educational purpose as well.</desc>

It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan. 1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic". But then something happened that would change the course of history forever.</desc>

When a certain amount of one color is stacked, an explosion occurs and the screen clears of those blobs, which then appear in the other players screen (either the CPU or a second player). When your screen is cleared before the other player, you move onto the next round, and so on until the final boss. The winner of that match is then crowned the Avalanche king.</desc>

Gameplay is fairly standard for RPGs, with turn-based battling by way of a menu of icons, and random battles. There's also a higher-than-normal emphasis on puzzles within dungeons.</desc>

It is very different from the contemporary Genesis title Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from the first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics. In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship. At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.</desc>

Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves. The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</desc>

She heads to planet Zebes in order to hunt down the leaders of the Space Pirates, who kidnapped an unique Metroid larva. Super Metroid is a platform game, which, like the previous Metroid games, is not divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated with doors which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is required to proceed in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao.</desc>

Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball. The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.</desc>

You then control an angel who helps guide the villagers in their town building, and can send down miracles to aid them in their needs.</desc>

Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario.</desc>

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends.</desc>

		<desc>Vortex was one of the few games designed to use the SNES Super FX 1 chip, a custom-made graphics accelerator RISC processor. The game is a 3D shooter similar to Star Fox by the same development studio, but with some subtle differences. Players can morph their vehicle at any time from the standard walker to a sonic jet, a land burner and a defensive hard shell, each with their own weapons, strengths and weaknesses. The player is cast as a soldier fighting the Aki-Do Forces, an evil empire bent on taking over the entire universe. To stop them, the player has access to an experimental mech, the Vortex, to travel the seven worlds of the Aki-Do system and destroy the bases.</desc>

But some people know about those sealed powers, and they don't want to free them for the sake of humanity, but for their own gain - such as the kingdom of Altena, which is slowly freezing and which can be saved only by the legendary powers.</desc>

Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint. The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.</desc>

Defeated enemies sometimes drop power-ups that improve the helicopter's standard weapon or equip it with homing missiles as secondary weapon. In addition to the standard "shooting mode" D-Force also features an "exploration mode". In exploration mode, the player's helicopter is attacked by animals instead of warplanes or other helicopters. In this mode, the shoulder buttons can be used to change the helicopters altitude and attack (or dodge) enemies at different heights.</desc>

He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen. The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions. The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars. Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.</desc>

		<desc>A puzzle game seen from a top-down perspective. The goal of each level is to open the exit by pushing a magic stone on a designated spot. May can also push objects one tile ahead without moving herself. This is often used to get the stone over water that she can't cross herself. May's other ability is to create magic bubbles. She can create bubbles in three different sizes. Bubbles will pop after a certain amount of time, depending on their size. If they pop while next to the stone or another bubble, the stone or bubble will be moved one space. Since May can create several bubbles simultaneously, it is possible, and often necessary, to create chain reactions to maneuver the stone into the desired position.</desc>
