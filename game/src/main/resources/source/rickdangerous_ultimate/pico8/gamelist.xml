		<desc>A TETRIS Clone for PICO-8. The main goal here was to make it compliant to the 2009 Tetris guideline (a big document the Tetris company uses that says exactly how a Tetris game should be made) though I disregarded that going back to it, so it's halfway or so there. Also, SRS isn't implemented properly, it's good enough but it's not perfect, and the title is a typo I thought was funny so I rolled with it.</desc>

This whole idea got born out of a marketing concept in which we planned to fit a game on a floppy disc. Someone came with a brilliant idea to use PICO-8 for that. We loved both the retro feel and ease of use that came with this tool. Technological constraints made it an intriguing design challenge.</desc>

		<desc>An adaptation for PICO-8 of the 1978 game "Super Star Trek". The original game was written by Bob Leedom and David Ahl and published in the book BASIC COMPUTER GAMES - Microcomputer Edition. It was an early example of a space turn-based strategy game, and it was entirely text-based. The original game was based on a CLI and text parser. This version is entirely based on a graphic user interface and can be controlled with the PICO-8 buttons, so it's a big change.</desc>
