		<desc>Burnin' Rubber is the game that was included with every Plus and GX4000 on a cartridge, in a bid to showcase the Plus machine's new hardware abilities. Therefore it was quite popular, although it did not really show off the Plus capabilities, being an early title and all. Despite that, it wasn't a bad game on its own and is considered one of the good racing games on the Amstrad.</desc>

		<desc>Fire &amp;amp; Forget II is a 1990 futuristic racing-shooting video game developed by Titus Arcade and published by Sega for the Master System, and by Amstrad for the GX4000. It is the sequel to Fire and Forget, which was developed by Titus France SA for a number of platforms including the ZX Spectrum. Fire &amp;amp; Forget II is one of a number of similar games which emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of Sega's popular arcade driving game Out Run (1986). It is notable for the variety of its enemy sprites, and for its use of parallax scrolling. It is also notable for being one of the first video games to be launched simultaneously on two consoles.</desc>
