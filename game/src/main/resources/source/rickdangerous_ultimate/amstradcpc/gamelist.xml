		<sortname />
		<desc>The player embodies a magician whose goal is to find and deliver 8 colleagues who were captured by a necromancer. The environment, represented in profile, is made up of about forty paintings interconnected by doors (one place can give access to four other places), which makes it complex to explore. To carry out his quest, he must discover the usefulness of the many objects found along the way and get rid of the enemies that threaten him. The player only has a few minutes to complete the mission, which requires reflexes, sense of direction, memory, and tactical sense.</desc>

You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance.</desc>

		<desc>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again.</desc>

		<desc>As the title suggests, this is a port of the great arcade game by Konami, and you'll be surprised how near to the original it is! The basic plot has no surprises; as any of the Turtles (or any two, as this game has one of the best two-player modes the CPC has ever seen) you must walk the corridors, streets and sewers and rescue your master Splinter and your friend April O'Neil from the clutches of Shredder, beating up his henchmen along the way. Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang all the old favourites are here!</desc>

		<desc>This menacingly-titled beat 'em up was the first in many martial arts titles from Australia's Melbourne House. Sixteen different moves are on offer, ranging from standard kicks to jumps, somersaults and roundhouse kicks. The move executed each time is defined based on the character's direction, the joystick/keyboard positioning, and on whether the fire button is depressed, in a system which became standard on single-button control systems.</desc>

		<desc>This license of the children's TV show set it as a Ghosts 'N Goblins-style hack-n-slash adventure. The Thundercat must defeat Mumm-Ra's forces, which range from dwarves to bats. Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.</desc>

You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one.</desc>

The player leads a party of four characters (with the option to either define your own characters or take a predefined group) through the land to eventually challenge, confront and defeat Yarod-Nor in his own castle. Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to trade, and develop your characters skills.</desc>

Your energy recharges if you stay still, so finding areas free of guards (kill these for money) and dogs (avoid them; killing them gains you nothing) is useful, especially as you only have one life. There's plenty of object manipulation involved, although only one item can ever be carried at a time.</desc>

Other bonus items are located around the levels, while yet more can be found by using your club creatively and adventurously. There are bosses and passwords after every few levels.

While the first game offers two players the opportunity for virtual head-to-head combat, the second is solely a single-player adventure with fewer fighting moves.</desc>

		<desc>Zap 't' Balls is most notable for its technical novelties. Amstrad experts would think it was running on a Plus, as what appear to be hardware sprites are moving smoothly at full speed. However, this was accomplished on a stock CPC by forming a stack within video RAM itself, a technique achieved by disabling interrupts. The game itself is similar to Pang. One or two players have 80 screens of balls to clear, by firing a rope vertically such that a ball will hit it. Upon doing this it splits into two balls of half the size, unless it is at the smallest size, when it will disappear. Each screen must be cleared within a time limit. Contact with a ball costs the player a life.</desc>

		<desc>Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower.</desc>

		<name>Jet Set Willy</name>
		<desc>Cult hero Matthew Smith followed up Manic Miner with a seminal platform game. Having struck it lucky in the first game, Willy now owns a lavish mansion with over 60 rooms linked in a 3D plane, and must tidy it all before his housekeeper will let him sleep. Each room has its own hazards, such as spikes, revolving razors and ropes. The route through the house must be navigated carefully, due to the multiple entrances to some rooms - this is perhaps the first action game where mapping is an advantage. Another innovation, to the chagrin of players everywhere, is manual protection - a sheet of colour-coded numbers.</desc>
