		<desc>As Valdyn aka "Lionheart", you will have to travel deep into the territory of your king's enemy to retrieve a stolen holy relic which happens to be named "Lionheart" as well. The game itself is a platform/hack'n'slay affair, similar to Rastan. You proceed through the world that is scrolling in all directions and cut everything to pieces with your trusty sword that is cocky enough to come close to you.</desc>

The game can be played from 1 to 4 players at once, with no difference between solo and multiplayer as no matter how many players play, the story stays the same for everyone. However, if you choose to play with only one player/knight, the other three will be the computer rivals.</desc>

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way. When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.</desc>

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based.</desc>

		<sortname />
		<desc>The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s). Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games.</desc>

As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.</desc>

The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.</desc>

Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation. Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of "No fuss, just fun" could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf. Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.</desc>

The real challenge here is to avoid the many walls on the back of the vessel while you are under attack. After the exterior has been cleaned from most of the enemy presence you take care of the ships' reactor core in a jump-and-run-like sequence. While floating in a non-gravity surrounding, lower the core's shields and then destroy it.</desc>

Taking place many years in the future in colonized space, military scientists have disposed of countless, defective military droids on an un-colonized terrestrial planet called Ryxx. The droids eventually become sentient and, by way of revenge, start an attack against mankind, using a station to continually create more war machines.

		<desc>Viewed isometrically, this role-playing game saw you leading a party of four intrepid souls on a mission to restore peace to the land. Sixteen levels awaited them, all filled with traps and monsters. Spells could be collected as the game went on, and multiple ones cast in quick succession. The characters could be split, and sent off on different routes and tasks to save time. The game’s title was inspired by its innovative use of light, or rather of darkness. Nothing could be seen without the torches your characters had; these meant that vision faded outside their circular arc. You had to manoeuvre the torch around to reveal secret areas, and it could be used to ward off some monsters, although it alerted others to your presence.</desc>

		<desc>Toobin' involves Biff and Jet racing their way down the rapids of a river, riding on tires. You rotate your tyre left or right, and drift as the current sends you, making sure to avoid the banks of the river, and the dividing lines in the middle. Hazards include crocodiles, stray logs and branches, and fishermen - you are armed with a limited supply of tin cans to take care of these. There are gates to slide through on the way down - these give you a points bonus. Each level has a strict time limit to adhere to, although there's a kickin' party at the end if you succeed.</desc>

The track itself, however, is patterned with dark and light shades of gray and can be very off-putting. Overall, Formula 1 Grand Prix is something and nothing.

While racing, it only offers a first-person perspective, but the game offers a replay mode as well. Indy 500 offers the ability to realistically set up the car, and any changes made to the car directly affect how it handles.</desc>

The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you got to be on land as well as in the air. Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.</desc>

In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.</desc>

		<desc>The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - "the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?" The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage. The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</desc>

To retrieve his body, he must progress through 50 levels, then a further 50 to escape before he can be put back together. Gameplay involves the character being on a rotating landscape with a set number of coins placed all over it. By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit.</desc>

You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends.

		<desc>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways. Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.</desc>

		<desc>One puck, and only two competitors. One is the computer, and the other is, of course, you. You get a chance to match your skills at this Air Hockey style game, over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal. There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</desc>

When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.</desc>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision.</desc>

The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green. When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</desc>

And the only way NATO can prevent that from happening is to reinforce their forces with convoys from the US and other countries. You are in command of one of the US attack submarines. You must hold the ocean against the Soviet navy at all costs, or the land battle will go badly. Part submarine simulator, part dynamic campaign, and part WW3 simulation, Red Storm Rising is an amazing look at modern warfare.</desc>

The goal of Supremacy is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system. The game was initially released for the Amiga and Atari ST computers in the beginning of 1990.</desc>

		<desc>Humans was released around February, and by judging by the response it received (around 75,000 units sold so far), many of you shared my opinion. Time has moved on a little, and we now find ourselves with a new tribe of Humans in the Jurassic periods (circa 18,000,000 BC, for the curious). If you already own Humans, or have played it, the only thing you need to know about the data disk is that everything is exactly the same, and all the original discoveries such as the rope, torch and wheel are present from level one - the difficulty level of which is equivalent to the later levels for the first effort.</desc>

This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics. The events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the James Pond series (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.</desc>

Villages supply taxes, wheat (the harvest of which you must personally initiate), pottery to sell and militias (for defense and for your army). A self-sufficient village is your aim, otherwise you'll have to finance it out of your own pocket. You'll also have to watch out for your popularity which, if it falls below a specified level, will result in rebellion.</desc>

Rotating each of the many mirrors on the level to send the beam onto the points the enemies hover over does this – reaching many of them will involve several attempts at finding the right combination of angles. Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, Tron-style.</desc>

In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R·Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

		<desc>R-Type II is a horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Irem in 1989. It is the second game in the R·Type series. The player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.</desc>

So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned. Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</desc>

Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump.</desc>

The main gameplay is influenced by Dungeon Master, but features sections in the open air battling bears as well as the dungeons. In the real-time combat sections you must choose weapons and spells instantaneously, using the mouse-based interface. You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from the first game to load in.</desc>

Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score. There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</desc>

The game is played across 30 levels., with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.</desc>

Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.</desc>

Okay, such a claim is obviously a wild exaggeration, but you can't fail to be impressed by the excellent course backgrounds and options available. The animation is very smooth on the eye, and the swing of the clubs isn't impossible to control either.</desc>

Reaching the control room will suffice, but a further challenge of finding the six pieces of a hidden bomb can be undertaken if you're brave. The game features texture-mapped visuals and a variable screen size, making it suited to anything from a humble A500 (most Doom-style games needed at least an A1200) or a well-accelerated machine.</desc>

It was one of the few Amiga games to include a Virtual Cockpit mode, and this can be controlled using the mouse with a quick button press. The game’s missions are set up in such a way that you are not necessarily the lead man. The two sides fight each other irrespective of your placement, and act on instinct with unusually complex AI, meaning that the exact nature of the missions vary each time you play.</desc>

Both launched from a carrier during Operation Desert Storm, you receive your missions and carry them out. The usual options apply, like configuring your aircraft, and choosing a pilot, but there are some more unusual options, like calling in sick for a mission. This causes you to skip a mission if you don't like the sound of it, but if you use it too much command may get suspicious. The flight model is realistic, and there are some animations. One feature missing from the PC version is the strategic side - you control the ground operations while flying to support them on the Amiga version.</desc>

The goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on.</desc>

As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify. The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.</desc>

At the end of each strip is a tree, so lift-off requires precision; too early and you will stall to the ground; too late, and you will crash into a tree. As the two players fly towards each other, the split screen is joint as they reach visual contact, and likewise split off again if they fly away from each other.</desc>

Although the view is top-down, the pitch is small and square, and the players appear huge on it. A range of moves including overhead kicks, trapping the ball and quick 1-2 passes can be mastered. Before each match your team can choose special moves to assign to each player - power shots with ludicrous curve, super dribbling (making the ball stick to your foot), and a Barge power to push players out of the way. A full world cup tournament is offered, which up to 8 human players can partake in, as well as single exhibition matches. The action replays feature a VCR-style control.</desc>

		<desc>The sun is about to go supernova and humanity must find a new home. All the population is packed into a huge fleet of ships and they set off for a suitable planet. Unfortunately the route goes straight through the territory of a hostile alien race, the Rexxons. The game is a space shooter but you also get surface missions on different planets. The main emphasis on the game is the graphics which were excellent when the game was released but this meant that the game was very short with just 7 levels. There are loads of cutscenes all with music from Holst's planet suite.</desc>

		<desc>This football game aims for a higher level of realism than most of its contemporaries. The game can be viewed top-down (similar to the Kick Off games) or side-on (similar to Manchester United Europe). Three different passing modes are offered, with the aim of providing precise one-touch passing or the ability for long-range direct through-balls. The match options include 10 skill levels, variable wind, five different pitch conditions, and variable match lengths. You can play league and cup tournaments featuring up to 32 of the game's teams, which are taken from the top clubs in top European countries.</desc>

The game hasn't real story and has quite a simple game play - the player controls a red space ship, flies straightforward, avoid obstacles and shoot enemies in various locations (mostly mountains with space background). The enemies are in many types, shapes and colours - spaceships, 'molecules', geometric figures, etc. If a spaceship flies too slowly, then it has a tendency to fall down. The player has 2 lives.</desc>

		<desc>This obscure coin-op comes from Gottlieb, a company best known for their pinball machines. The plot is that all kinds of mayhem have broken out in a nondescript street in the suburbs of Chicago. Swarms of insects have mutated into ferociously lethal creatures, rats and frogs have turned vicious, while toy tanks have come to life! Clearly your average, everyday pest control isn't going to be able to cope so it's time to call in the EXTERMINATOR! Who? Well he's certainly no wimp, all he needs to sort things out are his bare hands - and in this game you control one such disembodied hand. Houses are represented by a series of 3-D rooms where various baddies come buzzing, trundling, scurrying and leaping toward you.</desc>

After the heroes enter the sewers, the ceiling collapses behind them. The only way out is the way down, into a dungeon filled with monsters, traps and puzzles. Eye of the Beholder is a dungeon crawler RPG with a first-person perspective based on the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D rules. The starting party consists of four characters and up to two NPCs can join later. Combat and magic happen in real time. Fight over a dozen different monster varieties and cast over 40 spells. A point-and-click interface makes exploring, fighting, spellcasting and handling objects easy.</desc>

There are various scenarios for each, with air-to-air or ground missions, in "cold war" and full-scale war situations. Players can build up their pilot ranks through completed missions and medals. The game actually has two flight modes. In the "authentic" mode, you have only 2 weapon bays, but you have higher stealth rating. In the "theoretical" mode, you have 4 weapon bays like F-19 Stealth Fighter, but your plane is easier to detect due to a lower stealth rating.</desc>

There is a significant amount of playable options in FOFT and a considerable attention is paid to detail. For instance, if the player becomes tired of roaming through outer space they skim a planet or two (which plays in a similar fashion to David Braben's other game, Virus). During the docking sequence players can create their own programs for automated functions, using a built-in BASIC like language called SIMPLE.</desc>

You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await. The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.</desc>

It was the third game to use the SCUMM engine. The plot closely follows, and expands upon, the film of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. As the game begins, Indiana Jones has returned to his college, after reclaiming the Cross of Coronado. He is approached by businessman Walter Donovan, who tells him about the Holy Grail, and of the disappearance of Indy's father. Indy then travels to some of the places seen in the movie, such as Venice and the catacombs, after meeting fellow archeologist Elsa Schneider.</desc>

		<desc>Ingrid is Ingrid Bottomlow, the intellectual-but-clumsy gnome we met in Gnome Ranger. Her beloved home village Little Moaning is earmarked for a yuppie-friendly transformation by Jasper Quickbuck of Ridley's Manor. Ingrid has three cunning plans to stop him - producing a petition with everybody's signature, finding a more orthodox prevention method, and finally infiltrating Ridley's Manor itself by pretending to be a maid, and then finding proof that he's a dodgy geezer who should be locked up. These three quests can be played in any order, although they logically follow on from each other. She is accompanied by Flopsy the dog in the first 2 parts, and her cousin Daisy in the third.

		<desc>The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, Ishar, whose name means "unknown" in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel. Most of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time.</desc>

The former Fortress of Ishar became the new growth epicentre for the Aborean archipelago - The Isle of Kendoria and diverse islands named after Jarel's companions where another evil lord arose - Shandar. Zubaran, Ishar's current Ruler, hears of this. So, naturally, Shandar must be found and destroyed. This is the ultimate object of the game. The Silmarils standard of graphics and gameplay is sustained, and in parts improved upon, in this evolved creation of a larger and more involved fantasy world.</desc>

The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match). There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</desc>

There are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers.

		<desc>Private detective Tex Murphy is hired to investigate the murder of a university professor. It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. Tex soon learns of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter. Tex's first adventure takes the player through the seedy West Coast world of 2033, a setting that combines futuristic elements with film noir and "hardboiled" detective fiction styles. The game's main adventure portions are icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction.</desc>

It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on. These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you.</desc>

Sadly there's no sim to pit the MiG against the USAF or RAF, but five combat missions take in photo-reconnaissance in the Arctic, air-to-air combat over China, strafing terrorist trucks, a bombing raid against oil installations and destroying a nuclear reactor. The latter is the final mission (requiring 500 points to enter) which involves taking out air defences and landing on a runway to rearm.</desc>

Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao.

With skills at your disposal, you will be able to take fingerprints from almost anything, write in your detective notebook about conversations you find intriguing, and slowly but surely, outlining your suspect. Alas, many love affairs, plots, intrigues and what all not among other characters may be uncovered in your investigations, but that mustn't cloud your judgment for why you are here, to solve the Murder!</desc>

Tactics and training are hugely important due to the game's short time frame. The players each have individual personalities, and these have been factored in during the game. Sometimes players will drink too much, fall in love, or have personality clashes with their team-mates or with you, all of which have to be factored in.

The second game is a time-trials challenge, where you have to race a variety of vehicles over a number of courses against the clock. This is slightly easier than the arcade version and gives you the option to get some practice in. You have four different cars to control in Overdrive, ranging from a GP to a Super sports car. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, as you would expect. The controls are very responsive, and it goes without saying that it's incredibly playable. What makes it so tough is the speed.</desc>

There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren't using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability). Each level has a very different setting, and an end-of-level boss to defeat.</desc>

Your goal is find the spaceship so you can get off the planet and return home. To do this, you will need to make your way from the start to the exit of numerous levels which take place in a variety of environments. Throughout each level are a variety of objects which you can pick up; on many of the levels you will need to figure out how to use the objects available to you in order to reach the exit. Some objects can used (like a gun or keys), and objects may be thrown, moved around and stacked.</desc>

These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a "smart bomb", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process. Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.</desc>

In terms of pure beat-em-up action, Rise of the Robots is outclassed by the barely-better-than-16-bit BODY BLOWS games. ROTR is quite poor in the "special moves" area of beat-em-up gaming. The graphics? Well... the animations are good. The characters, when still, look very good too. When moving they are anything but realistic looking. Their movements are jerky and very repetitive. What's different in each version? Not a lot. All of them suffer from the poor control and jerky animation.</desc>

You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics. Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs.

There are lots of hidden sections as you progress, which open up more of the end sequence to you, as well as several subgames including a shoot 'em up mode.</desc>

Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end. You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time.

While each level has the standard disintegrating rocks to destroy, all but 2 of them have extra bad guys, with a range of attack patterns. There are a number of different weapons available, which are collected by moving your ship so that it crosses their paths as they float through space. Each of these can be powered up - some weapons start strong but can't be powered up as much as others; fortunately you can power up one weapon while using another.</desc>

		<desc>Storm Master is a 1991 video game for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC, produced by the now-defunct French developer Silmarils, which placed the player as the head of government for a fictional semi-medieval country. Similarly to most of the games produced by Silmarils, Storm Master took place on a European-fantasy world. Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.[1][2] The game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles.</desc>

There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</desc>

Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms. Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose.</desc>

		<desc>Zak McKracken is a tabloid reporter (and not a very good one at that). Based upon a psychadelic dream, Zak one day realizes that something is wrong -- Space Aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system. Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a magic crystal (or some sort of crystal), Zak manages to get the help of Anthropologist, Annie, and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. Between the four characters (all of which you control), you can destroy the dumbifying devices and save the earth. Not too bad for a tabloid reporter.</desc>

		<desc>Like its predecessor X-Out, Z-Out is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up. A horde of largely-organic enemies threaten the safety of your planet, and they must be destroyed over the course of six levels.There are power-ups available, but the game is less centered around these than some are. Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.</desc>

The graphics engine allows for multiple camera angles and viewpoints, and considerably detailed visuals. These required more advanced hardware than was common at the time, but a stick-figure mode was included as a compromise. The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them. You progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between. Advanced action replays are included as well, so you can review all that happened.</desc>

The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility. By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions.</desc>

The original protagonist is an old, dying man as the game starts out. He summons his grandchild and tells him about a vision he had, of an old friend who supposedly died more than forty years ago and warned him of a great evil rising again. He sends the youth on a quest to seek that old friend and find out what is behind that vision. Concerning gameplay, Ambermoon is similar to its predecessor.</desc>

Initially the player creates a single protagonist with randomly assigned attributes and no class designation. During the course of the game, additional characters (up to six active party members) can be found in different cities and other locations and recruited. Some of these characters already belong to established classes and come with their own abilities. Guilds of various classes (fighter, paladin, ranger, mage, monk, and thief) can be visited, where the protagonist and his class-less companions (if any) can be promoted.</desc>

That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp’s control. Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time.</desc>

		<desc>The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a Rambo doppelganger, which the developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style. Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</desc>

Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit.</desc>

You are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will track the bugs and hopefully stop them. The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting 'EN' symbols will restore your energy, and 'IQ' symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.</desc>

The computer racers include Loretta L’Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos. The courses are quite lengthy, and are laden with hazards and power-ups such as oil slicks and homing missiles. The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front – strange. The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / OutRun tradition.</desc>

As the game progresses, the screen scrolls sideways and evil gangsters pop up from behind windows and buildings. The player must take care not to hit innocent bystanders, including women, children, and pets strolling down the street. There are also two indoor scenes, including a warehouse filled with TNT and the finale that takes place inside a bank. Capone was released in the early years of the Amiga, and had a very unique look for its time.</desc>

For every hit the game shows a 3D and overhead view of the situation, so the player can plan the next steps accordingly. The golf game itself is menu driven: the player changes various parameters, e.g. the golf club, the direction, the golfer's position, the strength and if the ball is hit in the middle or an outer edge. According to those parameters the game calculates the hit, which even may result in a straight miss, and then the next planning phase starts. The player may play a championship with all 18 holes or a training round with a single hole.</desc>

Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

The levels also have different plains which are changed by either using a ladder or jumping. However, jumps and shots for his gun need to be picked up first - which is made more difficult by the fact that the symbols move over the level. Over the course of the game the difficulty and complexity rises at a steady rate, e.g. at first there are no enemies, later the enemies walk on pre-defined ways and even further down the path they actively try to hunt down Beppo.</desc>

The circuits are based on real ones, although the opposition (of which there are 9) are known simply by first names such as David and Paul. The display appears to use real 3D, with some fairly terrifying directional changes, although it doesn't tilt as you turn. A full map of your position relative to your rivals is presented at the top of the screen. Crashes cause gradual engine damage, reducing your initial 140mph top speed by a slight amount each time - you'll also lose time as you rejoin. Before each race you must set a qualifying lap, which allows you multiple attempts.</desc>

Dizzy starts at the bottom of the sea, and you have to get him to the top. You do this by jumping across bubbles, which only have a limited time before bursting. Enemies to avoid include sharks, octopuses and swordfish. Dizzy has limited oxygen, but more can be collected from O2 canisters. After completing a level, you get a bonus for the amount of pearls you collected and the amount of oxygen you have left.</desc>

Your aim as the "Doodlebug" is to make your way through five different levels (with three sub-levels each), killing baddies by jumping on their heads until you eventually make it to the final baddie. The most unique thing about this game is the novel theme at its centre: You can choose between five different coloured pencils to throw at your baddies (presuming you've picked some up).</desc>

There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction. The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy.</desc>

Move forwards/backwards by moving stick right/left. Change tracks by moving stick forwards/backwards. Pressing fire releases smoke with which you can shoot down enemy planes. Also en-route you will encounter mailbags which can be picked up for bonus points and water towers which if stopped at will replenish your water supply. Each level is more difficult to complete than the previous one with number and type of enemy forces increasing.</desc>

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</desc>

The game takes place in Tokyo. While all three characters explore almost the same areas, each of the heroes has their own story to follow and puzzles to solve. You can choose which character you would like to play first and when you have finished all three sub-plots, you'll get a final with all three characters acting altogether. The game features cartoonish, comics-style graphics, unique icon-based interface and non-linear plot.</desc>

Large distances can be traversed simply by issuing directions and letting the characters follow them. The cities have very detailed buildings, but there is little variety between them.

Players control one of seven large beasts that battle each other to determine the fate of the planet. Matches feature many of the conventions of fighting games from the era, including special moves and gory finishing maneuvers. Various ports were released for home consoles and personal computers. Efforts to perfectly emulate the arcade original have been unsuccessful due to an unusual copy protection method that the developers used. Toys, comics, a novel and other merchandise tie-ins were produced. A massive meteor strike has devastated the planet Earth.</desc>

The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.</desc>

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice.</desc>

		<desc>Viewed from above, the task in each level of X-It is to create a path to walk through to the exit, by moving blocks around a walled arena. The movement physics are fairly true to real life - most blocks can only be pushed if there is a block's worth of space behind them, and nothing immediately ahead of them. The levels are full of gaps, through which blocks can be pushed - this has the double effect of freeing up extra room in the level, and allowing you to walk over those spaces. Other hazards include ice which prevents blocks from stopping until they go past it. Falling through holes loses you one of your 3 lives - you also have 5 attempts at each screen.</desc>

		<desc>In Zombi you control a team of four intrepid travelers, who have landed their helicopter on the roof of a shopping centre in the hope of finding fuel. The problem is that, with Hell full, Zombies are walking the earth, devouring humans as they please. Zombi is a point and click adventure game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out.</desc>

What the legend didn’t say is that the Castle is also filled with deadly traps, riddles and monsters. Surviving is not only a question of defending your life. Karadoc also has to prove his wit in collecting objects, putting them to the right use, mastering spells and solving tasks posed by the gods. Quick reflexes and jumping skill wouldn’t hurt either.</desc>

		<desc>A rather unique war game simulation. You can decide to be several different people and the game is created after the way you make your choice. The game engine and interface are pretty simple as all you have to do is to deploy units, offer support to your allies and decide on what military you are going to need. Depending on what you choose to do the news will change in the a newspaper you can read (the is how the game tells about all events in the game) which is rather nice, because that makes the overview of the game very good. The game does offer pretty good graphics all though it isn't really needed for a game like this. But is definitely a plus.</desc>

Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection with the availability of the "Knight" class, unavailable in AD&amp;D non-Dragonlance RPGs.</desc>

		<desc>Garrison was produced by Rainbow Arts, a highly skilled European Amiga demo group, as a Gauntlet clone. In case you're not familiar with Gauntlet, it's a multi-directional-scrolling, top-down view, dungeon based shoot-em-up, (phew). You and some friends dash around various dungeon levels, collect potions, treasure and food, killing ghosts, goblins and anything else that looks at you oddly. The various baddies are generated by some object or other, a collection of bones in the case of the ghosts, and if you destroy these generators, you at least know that after wiping all the remaining enemy no more will be produced. Some enemies fire projectiles at you, some just drain health by making physical contact.</desc>

		<desc>The first game in the Realms of Arkania trilogy was the Blade of Destiny. It combines all the best characteristics of that times RPG's, like an extensive story line, first person view mode, cave exploring, scenery and freedom over your own actions. This game was an immediate hit when it was first released, forcing the producers to make a new English version almost over night! This delayed the sequel to the game, Star Trail, for a whole year. The game is incredibly huge for the time it was made. A lot of work was put into creating the world, including history, geography, folklore, races and NPC's. The story is epic, as all RPG's... You play the role of six different people;</desc>
