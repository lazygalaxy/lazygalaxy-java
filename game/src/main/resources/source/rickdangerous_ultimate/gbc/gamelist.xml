		<desc>Mario Golf on Game Boy Color isn't a straight port of the N64 game - it's a totally different game in its own right. It is a combination of a golf game and an RPG. As in an RPG, you choose your character at the beginning, with various strengths and weaknesses, and throughout the course of the game, your character gains experience points through winning matches or playing mini-games. Experience points can be distributed to various skills, such as putting, which makes it easier for you to do well. There are quite a few skills, and no two characters you can create will play in exactly the same way.</desc>

You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant. The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made. The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away form their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.</desc>

In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen.

The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man.</desc>

There are largely-switch-based puzzles to solve on each one, and different routes through to completing them. Indy is variously armed with a pistol, machine gun, grenades and his ubiquitous whip. Each level has a password, and ends with a clip advancing the story. As well as Soviets, your foes include scorpions, snakes and jellyfish.</desc>

Locations include the city, subway and sewers, the docks and a warehouse. The levels are usually crawling with enemies that Spider-Man can beat up with kicks and punches.

In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last.</desc>

		<desc>The classic Atari 2600 game YAR'S REVENGE has made its way to the Game Boy Color. You take control a giant space fly known as a Yar, and you must destroy the Qotile base on the other side of the screen. But you must first get through the large shield that guards the base. Fortunately, you have an unlimited supply of missiles to destroy the shield, or you can fly into the shield and eat a brick. Once there is an opening in the shield, touch the Qotile base with the Yar to activate the Zorlon Cannon. Once activated, you can fire the cannon to destroy the base. As you progress through the 250 levels, the game moves faster and becomes more challenging. Help Yar destroy the Qotile in YAR'S REVENGE.</desc>
