		<desc>Vasara is a 2D arcade vertical scrolling shoot'em up, taking place in an alternative 1600s Japan, featuring ahistorical elements such as giant robots normally found in sci-fi shooters. The game follows the typical manic shooter/bullet hell concept - players (up to two in co-op) fly forward on hover bikes and shoot enemies while trying to avoid many projectiles fired at them. Vasara has three playable characters: Yukimura Sanada, Keiji Maeda, and Saiga Magoichi - each specializing in a different weapon. Besides the standard shot, screen clearing bombs and charge attacks are available.</desc>

This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The player's bioship can also collect power-ups to grow bigger (becoming more powerful), and can acquire spherical pods which attach to the ship and increase its firepower.</desc>

		<desc>Boggy '84 is one of those games of which countless numbers were made in the early eighties during the homecomputer boom. It is slightly similar to Mappy or Space Panic but without the refinements of said games. You are a man who must collect a set of keys on a level with several floors. You can jump between floors using springboards, which gives you an advantage over your enemies, who must use the ladders to climb between floors. You must also use those in order to descend to a lower floor, mind you. Later levels add touches such as a a ski slope which you must ascend while avoiding the baddies. Hitting them from below will put them out of action, though.</desc>

As well as a forward-firing gun, the car can be made to jump huge distances. This is necessary to avoid background obstacles such as rock falls and broken bridges.</desc>

		<desc>A fast moving platform game in which the player controls the Indiana Jones-esque and unfortunately named 'Edward Randy'. The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.</desc>

Causing an enemy to explode fills a meter, and every enemy destroyed before the meter depletes adds to the current chain and again refills the meter. Holding the laser weapon over a large enemy will hold the meter steady and slowly accumulate hits. In this way it is possible to create a single chain out of any of the 5 stages.</desc>

It uses similar hardware to Capcom's 1942, but it is more of a spiritual successor to Capcom's earlier shooter Vulgus. It takes place in a science fiction alien hive where you must pilot your ship through many stages protected by insects, some as large as your craft, and some even larger.</desc>

The game's biggest features are the parallax scrolling which occurs in the background, and the sensation of inertia that is applied to the motion of the ship. The ship is equipped with two kinds of weapons. You can fire the dual shot gun which can only release one pair of shots on the screen at a time, but has an unlimited supply, by tapping the first fire button. The single shot gun can fire a rapid stream of shots on the screen at one time by holding the second fire button down, but it is limited in ammo according to the number of charges indicated on the bottom.</desc>

F-1 Dream is not one of Capcom's best known games. From a top-down perspective and decorated with cute "deformed" graphics, it may offer a serious challenge. There are essentially two race instances: first you have to beat the clock in a single lap to qualify for a good position in the race, and second you have to beat your opponents. You also have to keep an eye on your car's condition, as the tyres and body wear out, so part of your strategy must consider pit stops.</desc>

While maintaining the same classic 'look' of its predecessor, Gaplus's graphics are a definite improvement over those of "Galaga"; the game's increased color palette and subtle use of shading making the attacking aliens look rather more solid.</desc>

One such planet to be colonized was the Earth-like planet Gloria which happened to have an enormous natural supply of gold. This discovery became pivotal to Gloria's emigration, so much that emigrators would be impoverished by the cost of reaching the planet. Because of this, life on the planet thrived in a setting similar to the American Old West. Though poor, the gold trade aided the Glorian's in advancing technology and knowledge, so much that among the inhabitants lived talented inventors and engineers.</desc>

If one possessed by a shikigami can gather talismans of the five Chinese elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water) from five demons serving Guwange, then infiltrate Gokumon and slay Guwange, the shikigami will be destroyed and the one possessed will not suffer a premature death.</desc>

While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming.

		<desc>Puzzle Bobble (known as Bust-A-Move outside of Japan) is a spin-off of the Bubble Bobble series, featuring themes from the original game (such as enemies trapped in bubbles by the cutesy dinosaur duo Bub and Bob that must be popped). Players attempt to clear a board of colored bubbles by firing other bubbles at an angle and matching multiple bubbles of the same color. Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.</desc>

		<desc>Rough Ranger was certainly SunA's worst act of stealing from other games. Not only is the gameplay almost identical to Namco's Rolling Thunder, its animations also were clearly used as a template for the graphics. It really almost is a re-skinned Rolling Thunder with new levels, the only real additions being simultaneous 2-player gameplay and a stage map showing the current progress in the game in between stages, while all extra weapons got cut, except an alternative amunition type for the standard pistol.</desc>

		<desc>Son Son is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. [Input: Joystick 4 ways]</desc>

The players cannot collide or hinder each other.</desc>

The opponents are tough, but simple. This game has no special moves (and has only punch, kick, and jump buttons), and all characters have insanely high energy. So you pretty much just wail away at each other with punches and kicks until someone falls down. An ambulance will show up to haul away your defeated opponent, and a girl in the audience will come out to congratulate you</desc>

The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks.</desc>

Players will face a boss encounter every ten stages and the game ends after the 30th stage.</desc>
