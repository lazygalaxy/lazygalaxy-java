		<name>Banjo-Kazooie</name>
		<sortname />
		<desc>Banjo-Kazooie's fairy tale back story is reminiscent of Snow White's. A gnarled, ugly witch named Gruntilda asks her magical cauldron who is the fairest of them all. Of course, the pot's answer doesn't please the hag-- he singles out Banjo's sister, Tooty. When Tooty turns up missing, Banjo and his birdie buddy Kazooie set out to find her. The worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are gigantic, and chock full of crazy items to collect. Musical Notes, Puzzle Pieces ("Jiggies"), Mumbo Tokens, and Jinjoes are just some of the swag that Banjo must stuff in his backpack to complete his adventure.</desc>

Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final showdown.</desc>

		<desc>Sumner's brother Garm releases Skorne from the Underworld. Sumner has summoned the four mighty heroes (a warrior, a valkyrie, a wizard, and an archer) to stop Skorne from taking over the land. They must travel to the four realms of the land and free them from Skorne's four guardians. Once the guardians are destroyed, their keys unlock a desecrated temple, where the heroes battle Skorne. After facing defeat, however, Skorne flees back to the Underworld. The heroes must then find the 13 runestones that will open the Underworld, where they face Skorne again and destroy him for good.</desc>
