		<name>Cave Noire</name>
		<sortname />
		<desc>Cave Noire is a roguelike. The game evolves around four quests (killing monsters, freeing fairies or collecting gold/orbs) with ten difficulties each. The difficulty determines how big the target number is, the stats the player starts with and what monsters are encountered. Starting a quest creates a randomly generated dungeon where the player has one chance to reach the goal - death means a new dungeon has to be created. Beating a difficultly level unlocks the next; this is also the one thing the game saves.</desc>

		<desc>In this Tetris-style game, you play as Dr. Mario, who must drop differently coloured pills onto viruses to remove them from the bottle. Each pill is split into two, with each side being of one of three different colours, red, blue or yellow. Align three pills of the same colour to a virus of the corresponding colour (or any combination of pills and viruses totaling four or more) and it will be removed from the bottle, along with the aligned pills. The level is cleared when there are no viruses left, and the game is over when the pills reach the top and Dr. Mario can't drop any more pills.</desc>

		<desc>Picross 2 is the Japanese only sequel to the Game Boy puzzle game, Mario's Picross. Your goal is to reveal the hidden picture inside each grid by chipping away the correct squares. Clues along the grid's edges help you figure out which squares should be chipped away, and which should be left alone. The puzzles are much more advanced than those in Mario's Picross - easy puzzles are in a 15x15 grid, while standard Picross puzzles are four 15x15 grids connected together, solved one section at a time.</desc>

There are ten missions with different objective ranging from restoring power to a power plant, to 'seek and destroy' missions. The player can guide the tank freely across the over world, but there are enemy patrols that will open fire. The alternative is going though underground tunnels, where there are spots to replenish the tank and its weapons. The player only has a limited amount of time for each mission, and shielding for the tank. If either runs out, the game is over.</desc>
