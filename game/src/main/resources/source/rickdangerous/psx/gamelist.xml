		<desc>Disney's animated film TARZAN gets the videogame treatment and makes his way to the PlayStation. The game follows the plot of the movie: you must help Tarzan grow from a boy to an adult in the span of 14 levels of action. While many of the levels offer platform-jumping, vine-swinging fun, some of them recreate some of the action sequences from the movie. No matter where he is, Tarzan must collect the tokens and fruit that are scattered about. Collecting 100 tokens earns an extra life, and the fruit can be used to dispose of enemies. If you can collect the four pieces of Jane's baboon drawing, you can earn the chance to play a bonus level. You've got to help the young ape-man discover his place in the world with TARZAN.</desc>

Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan.</desc>

		<desc>In the near future, mankind's tinkering with the science of genetics and the developmental process of genome mapping has resulted in the accidental creation of a new disease known as EINDS. This disease, which attacks a cell's DNA and halts mitosis and meiosis (the processes that allow our cells to duplicate), has killed nearly a billion people and no hope of a cure has been discovered. With the disease spreading rapidly, it is feared that the manipulations of DNA will lead to mankind's complete undoing.</desc>

The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters.</desc>

Every time your pager beeps, the boss needs you to steal something for him if you don't get to a payphone and answer the message, you'll be in hot water (or is that cold water at the bottom of the East River). After receiving your mission, you'll have to navigate city streets that are bustling with pedestrians, cops (your worst enemies), and traffic jams. Because you're pressed for time, you can't just walk to your destination on foot -- that would take too long. Instead, you'll have to go car jacking, the art of physically removing people out of their vehicles and stealing it.</desc>

Moves are carried out in typical fighting game style (button combinations) and the game handles very well. All the characters are pretty much balanced and fair except some moves are a bit too excessive. A few characters can execute attacks that really take off way too much damage and this is real the problem with the game.</desc>

The scenes from the game come from his memories as he is undergoing this ordeal, with players taking on his previous adventures that lead him up to this point. It is a spy-thriller in the vein of James Bond, and as Cord remembers more, the overall story begins to make more sense.</desc>

		<desc>The unwitting recipient of a destructive prosthesis -- a powerful blaster grafted onto his left arm -- John Cain awakes to find himself being hunted down by a military organization, with no recollection of the events leading to this predicament. Inspired by Contra and other such titles, One is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter in which players find themselves traversing a variety of locales, from futuristic Blade Runner-esque cities to remote mountainous regions, all in search of answers. The central gameplay mechanic is the player's Rage meter. Simply put, John Cain is fueled by rage. By destroying objects, killing people, and generally causing all kinds of wanton mayhem, he will increase in power.</desc>

Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger. There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves?.</desc>

		<desc>You throttle your engine, the bikes beside you are roaring and ready to let fly. The starting light turns green and you hit the gas, sending your bike flying over the initial jump at Bank One Ballpark. The rest of the field tries to find their bearings after being blown away by your aggressive start. You fly around corners, shredding up the dirt which paves the course. Your arch-rival closes in, but you cut him off on the sharp "hairpin" turn and he's left spinning out on the side. You throttle up and do a little show-boating for the crowd as the checkered flag is waved in your honor! If you thought that little teaser sounded good, then brace yourself for Supercross 2000 for the PlayStation.</desc>

Because he couldn't remember who he really was or where he came from, he decided to stay there and teach martial arts and paint one of his personal hobbies. After his arrival, he became friends with the various townsfolk, who in return treated him like one of their own. Still, who he was and what happened to him in his past bothered him; he was afraid it would come back to haunt him one of these days. And it did. One day, an organization in control of large Gears, mechanized robots built for war purposes, came into the small town of Lahan. Fei was at the center of attention and with no hesitation jumped into a nearby Gear and started fighting back.</desc>

Games range from a beatmania-style of timed gameplay (where certain buttons are pressed during certain beats) to shooting down airplanes, attacking UFOs, and even a certain "massage" level that is so analogous to a sexual experience that if gamers only heard the instructions and game mechanics, they would swear they were playing a game rated A for adult.</desc>

At the end of some levels, the player must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy.</desc>

But there is more. The word "rhythm" in the title has to have a meaning, right? And it does have. At the heat of a fight, if your Special Bar is completely full, you can perform a Beat Combo. It is basically like if Beatmania for some crazy reason, were implemented in a fighting game. By performing a Beat Combo, you will have to rhythmically press in turn one of the four frontal buttons of the directional pad, according to the beat.</desc>

The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as "pick up, aim &amp; throw". In Rakugaki Showtime different "drives" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a "Forward Drive Throw", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a "Backward Drive Throw", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage.</desc>

Multi-national companies are lined up at your door, paying you to complete certain objectives, which mainly include the destruction of a certain target or another mech. The more you complete, the better the pay and job offers, therefore allowing you to build the ultimate Armored Core. Apart from the single player campaign, you can take on a friend in a multiplayer battle. You each control a mech, and battle it out in a large war area (ranging from huge cities to desert planes).</desc>

Of course as in the original, lots of power-ups are available to add to the excitement and bring new strategic considerations into the mix. A single-player "story mode" is available, but the most significant advance in this version of the classic game is that it allows up to five players to compete at once.</desc>

		<desc>Casper's friends have been hexed by an evil spell! The king of ghosts has created an imprisoning device that sends them to different locations across the globe. You must help Casper rescue his friends, but you only have the first ten map pages. If you can find the rest, they will each lead you to a friend. Collect the pieces of the device that sent your friends away by defeating three evil bosses. If you can manage to find everything in the game, then you'll advance to a special level in the lost city of Atlantis. Watch out for your uncles and tourists, though, because they will make your journey most difficult.</desc>

		<desc>This Castlevania game was originally released on the Sharp X68000 (a home computer relatively unknown outside of Japan) but never made it to the worldwide audience. This conversion is meant to fix that, a remake of the original for the PlayStation with a good deal of new features. This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.</desc>

		<desc>Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing," "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely discouraged either.</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Slump was one of the first manga done by Akira Toriyama, widely known as the creator of Dragon Ball. The story revolved mainly around a robot named Arale, made by Dr. Slump (a professor) and her friends and their weird adventures. It was a gag manga with talking clocks and animals, time machines, toilet humor, and all-out cartoony zaniness. It was even made into a TV series in the early 1980s, which I still have fond memories of. In 1997, when Dragon Ball GT ended, a ''new'' Dr. Slump took it's time slot. This one was kind of like the old one and had the same characters as before but they were drawn differently.</desc>

This is their first crack at the whip with a PlayStation fighting game. The game is weapons based, meaning there is no hand-to-hand combat that does not incorporate weapons. The storyline is in line with the Koei war sims, so this is a fighting game based on real history. The characters are pulled straight from the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Each character is either based on or tied to one of the legendary warlords who fought to unite under their own kingdom.</desc>

In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle. On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war.

The game involves commanding either the Soviets or Allies through 14 different missions, which vary depending on the side you choose. In order to amass your troops (consisting of tanks, infantry, naval and air forces), you must first build various structures with your available funds. Each map screen will have two types of natural resources (ore and gemstones) that can be collected to finance your operation. Missions generally involve building a base, mining resources and generating a mix of troops to mount an assault on the enemy's base.</desc>

Not only is the request both vague and cryptic, stating simply: "Infiltrate the underground urban complex, Amber Crown,", but it also bypasses normal channels of communication and is sent directly to the Raven in question, without anyone else seeing the message. No sender name or corporate affiliation is mentioned, but the monetary reward promised is massive. Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge. With interest piqued, the Raven climbs into the AC and heads toward Amber Crown.</desc>

Rather than focusing on traditional racing elements, Codemasters has taken the mechanics and structure of British Touring Car Championship and slapped it into a PlayStation CD. Because of this, the TOCA series is considered a niche racing game; something on the outskirts of the mainstream.</desc>

A pointing device at the bottom of the screen is used to aim and launch a randomly generated bubble toward others of the same color. Since launched bubbles can ricochet off walls, the challenge comes from estimating the angle you'll need to create potential matches.

		<desc>When Gex is watching TV one day, he discovers that Rez has kidnapped Agent Xtra (the agent from Gex: Enter the Gecko's backstory), head of the TV Terrorist Defense Unit, to get to him. He teleports to the batcave-like lair he has in the Media Dimension, and begins another adventure. Each level parodies a certain aspect of television culture (here the levels exist as stand-alone channels). Gex enters each level through a television set. He must collect remote controls to advance to the next level in order to complete his mission and rescue Xtra.</desc>

The use of the gems is inspired by the The Infinity Gauntlet comic book series.</desc>

The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor.</desc>

While in the "Real World", the game is adventure-like; find and collect items and/or keys to open certain doors. When you enter the dream sequences, called the Territories, the game becomes a platform game.</desc>
