Because the game follows the movie so closely, the first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet computer and escaping through time is one of the hardest and something that most players remember with love/hate.</desc>

While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that can travel between parallel worlds, were captured and turned into badniks.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well. Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through.</desc>

		<desc>Budokan is a martial arts game covering Karate (unarmed combat), Kendo (using a wooden sword), Nunchaku (using piercing chain weapons) and Bo (using a staff). The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high. You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.</desc>

Plenty of gunmen will attack our hero from all the sides. Dick can only move to the right or to the left. He can use his pistol gun to take out enemies who are in front or behind him.</desc>

Yes, years before Rayman appeared, we already had a hero who used detachable appendages to attack his enemies. Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds – such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.</desc>

He can change his shape into various other forms (hence the "Chameleon"). This gives him special abilities which must be used to pass each of the game's 100+ stages. An interesting point about Kid Chameleon is that the game has 100+ levels (most of which are very, very difficult) which must be played in sequence AND there is no save feature or password feature - which means completing this game would be a major feat of endurance (and patience).</desc>

This combined with the many flashing gaudy colors the game throws at you leads me to believe that it was born out of a bad acid trip. There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun. The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.</desc>

By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.</desc>

		<desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.</desc>

The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies.

The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system. Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It's not exactly clear. So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter.</desc>

Two small dinosaurs with very large hammers, Charlie and Smiley, make their way through numerous screens of platforms and ladders filled with enemies. Their only method of attack is to bash a hole in the ground, wait for an enemy to fall into it, and then bash the enemy in the head, which causes the enemy to fall and transform into items and delicious food. There are five worlds, each with several screens and large boss at the end, as well as a minigame between worlds where bonus items can be earned. The game can be played alone or two-player cooperatively.</desc>

		<desc>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.</desc>

With over 800 players based on the 1992 season, all of the series trademarks including play-by-play commentary, authentic playbooks and instant replays are intact. Battery backup support is available for season play.

The NHL license ensures that real teams and players of the era are included, with a full league and playoff system. Many game options can be toggled - the infamous fighting is option, as are the penalties and offsides. The control system makes it possible to execute one-touch passes, and several special trick moves to quickly advance the ball. As a bonus feature, it included 'Hockey Card' profiles of every player on CD, and interviews with the stars of the game.</desc>

		<desc>This follow-up to Thunder Blade is very similar to the original arcade game. Get into your helicopter and blast away at the numerous enemies with your cannon and missiles. The four stages all follow a similar pattern: the first part is from a perspective behind your helicopter where you not only have to dodge enemy fire but also obstacles like buildings or caves. In between, face off against one or two smaller boss enemies. When the first part of a level is finished, the view switches to an overhead perspective for the confrontation with the level end boss.</desc>

Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most.

		<desc>After many generations of peace, the Dark Forces have assembled again, and as a member of the USS Freedom Forces, it is your job to defeat them once again. This means you will have to complete numerous large levels always searching for secrets to pick up and enemies to shoot. To do this, you can pick up three different, upgradeable shots: a multiple, a laser and a rebound. You can also go into wheel-mode (as long as you have enough special energy) or use a rope. In wheel-mode, you are invincible and can lay mines or explore previously unreachable areas.</desc>

Coming from an unknown developer it was released with little fanfare and advertising but has become one of the best demonstrations of what the genesis/megadrive is capable of. The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot) which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different buttons.</desc>

Streets of Rage 3 is a faster paced release with longer levels, a more complex plot (which in turn leads to more in-depth scenarios complete with interactive levels and multiple endings) and the return of traps such as pits. Dash and dodge moves were added to each character's arsenal of moves, and weapons can now only be used for a few times before breaking.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua Racing is a home port of Sega's first ever 3D, polygon-based racing game for the arcade. The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a beginner, intermediate, or expert track, competing against a second player or computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls are very "arcadey" and players can see the leap they made from here to Daytona. The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is of note as it is the only game for the system which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua Processor). The chip is a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D capability) and is very similar to the SNES's SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and Stunt Race FX.</desc>

These special attacks also need that you have your KI bar (which unlike energy one, is rechargeable) to a considerable level and the only way to block them is by means of a long button combination.</desc>

You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical "jump and run" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.</desc>

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them. The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</desc>

The police patrol the various courses, so if you're not careful you can get busted. Road Rash II is not just a racing game but also a fighting game.</desc>

The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account. The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one "professional foul" (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.</desc>

There are different game types, such as regular races (challenges), time trials, and battle arenas, in which you have to survive for a set amount of time while enemy vehicles charge. Other players can be shot to slow them down.</desc>
