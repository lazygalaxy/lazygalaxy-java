        <desc>Set in a parallel world resembling Japan's Taish≈ç period, the people have discovered the powerful Blood
            Swords, the titular Akai Katana. Requiring human sacrifices to unleash their immense destructive power,
            these swords have been used by the empire to crush neighbouring countries. However, all the bloodshed and
            power gained through sacrificing close family members has made some of the swordsmen reconsider. With new
            fighter planes and the powered up swords at their disposal, this small band of rebels now fight back against
            the tyrannical empire.
