		<name>Airline Pilots (deluxe, Rev B)</name>
		<desc>The game presents you with two choices ? training or free flight. Training takes you through a series of basic tests aimed at testing your overall proficiency as a pilot. These range from simple takeoffs and banking manoeuvres to hazardous flying, with simulated engine failure and bad weather conditions. In this mode, most of the flight controls are not used, leaving the player to simply steer the aircraft with the flight stick.In free flight mode, the game becomes much more like an actual simulator. The player must use the throttle control, flaps, undercarriage and pitch &amp; yaw adjustments to fly the plane through a series of computer-generated rings. On-screen text and speech prompt players on when and how to use these controls. Each ring passed through adds time to the on-screen timer, which, upon reaching zero, ends the game.</desc>

It is known as Dynamite Deka EX in Japan, and is a direct sequel to Dynamite Deka, meaning in its localised form, Asian Dynamite is a direct sequel to Die Hard Arcade, with the references to the movie franchise removed.nnnnThe game has not been ported to home platforms, nor has it even seen a US release.

		<name>Capcom vs. SNK 2 Millionaire Fighting 2001</name>
		<desc>Capcom vs. SNK 2 combines characters and gameplay elements from various Capcom and SNK fighting games, mainly the Street Fighter and The King of Fighters seriesthough elements are also borrowed from the Fatal Fury and Samurai Shodown series.    In contrast to the original Capcom vs. SNK, characters no longer have a specific "Ratio." Instead the player can select up to three characters in a team and give an amount or ratio (up to four) to each as desired. In console versions of the game, players can also choose a 1-on-1 game or a 3-on-3 game in arcade mode with the ratio system removed.    Unlike the first game, which was based on the King of Fighters-style two-strength, four button system of punches and kicks, Capcom vs. SNK 2 is based on the three strength, six-button system of punches and kicks, native to the Street Fighter series, with the SNK characters being tweaked to fit the 6-button style. The overall system is derivative of Street Fighter Alpha, however, a number of different fighting styles called "grooves", which mimic other Capcom and SNK games, are included in the engine. These dictate both the character's Super Gauge system, and special techniques, such as dashes, running, and guard cancels, called "Subsystems".    There are six grooves in total, each designtated with a letter, along with custom grooves that can be programmed in home versions of the game. Each player designates prior to the match which groove his or her team will use.</desc>

		<desc>Become a funky gymnastic back flipping, somersaulting, wall climbing virtual reality squash player. Travel by a virtual express train to an interstellar cosmic recreation room and smash the blocks.    Break all the blocks in the stage within the time limit, then the player can run to the next stage. There are 50 stages in this game, with many different routes to the final stage. Using a trick smash (there are 28 patterns) increases the destructive power of the ball, allowing the player to complete the stage faster. The penalty for using trick smash is a faster decrease in remaining time. There are normal blocks, unbreakable blocks, bonus blocks and various sizes of blocks moving in various patterns. The ball will also rebound differently from different blocks.</desc>

		<desc>Crazy Taxi is an open world racing video game.    The main objective of the game is to pick up customers and take them to their chosen destination as quickly as possible. Along the way, money can be earned by performing stunts such as near misses with other vehicles. The player is directed to a destination by a large green arrow at the top of the screen. The arrow does not adjust based on obstacles, but rather points in the general direction of the destination. Once the player arrives near the destination, they must stop within a specified zone. When the destination is reached, that customer's fare is added to the player's total money earned. Ratings are then awarded depending on how long the player took to complete the journey. If the customer's timer runs out before the player reaches the destination the customer jumps from the taxi.</desc>

		<name>Giant Gram 2000 - All Japan Pro Wrestling 3 Brave Men of Glory</name>
		<desc>Giant Gram 2000 is a BRUTAL arcade fighting game. But don't let that make you think this game is not about wrestling.Each wrestler has a huge moveset that will take time and dedication to learn. Since this is a NAOMI arcade game, the controls most resemble those of a 3d fighter. This may discourage many players but is very rewarding if you take time to learn the system. Because there is this system, there are many combos and chain wrestling in this game. For instance, Misawa can strike his opponent with a right forearm off the grapple if you press up and X. However, if you hit X as Misawa connects with the first strike, Misawa will combo the first strike with a left forearm followed by another right. The combo system here reminds me of learning the classic combos of Street Fighter 2. Awesome stuff. Also button combinations can turn a standard German suplex into a DEVASTATING release German suplex or a German suplex into a bridging pin. Just hit the button at the right moment and a standard move will turn into a PUNISHING AND BRUTAL one. So many possibilities with this combination system.</desc>

		<desc>Ikaruga is a shoot-em-up arcade game which brings a perfect blend of classic arcade shooting and original gameplay. The player's ship can switch between two different 'polarities': White and Dark. The Dark polarity can absorb dark colored enemy bullets while the White polarity can absorb white-colored enemy bullets. If the player kills 3 enemies of the same color in a row, a combo is built up that adds to the score.</desc>

		<name>Inu no Osanpo (Japan, Export, Rev A)</name>
		<desc>Inu no Osanpo simulates the experience of walking a dog. Players first choose one of six breeds of dog to walk: Poodle, Pug, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Shiba Inu, Labrador Retriever, or Siberian Husky. The difficulty of the game changes depending on the breed of dog chosen. After selecting a dog, the player selects one of three possible walking routes, each with a unique scenario. Route A, intended for beginners, is a walk to the pet store in order to buy dog food. Route B, of intermediate difficulty, is a simulated walk to a field so that the dog can play with a frisbee. Route C, the most difficult path, takes the player through a city on his/her way home from the dog park.    Once a dog and route have been chosen, the walk begins. The goal of Inu no Osanpo is to maintain the dog's happiness long enough to complete the entire route. This is displayed in-game via a "mood meter" and the presence of musical notes around the dog's head. Players must move the plastic leash-shaped controller to steer their dog away from danger; such as traffic and larger dogs, and towards points of interest such as cats. The player must also avoid garbage and rotten food that is left on the road in order to prevent the dog from eating it and becoming sick. While the virtual dog is never injured, failure to keep the dog out of danger decreases its mood meter. In addition, players must move at the right pace in order to keep the dog happy. Walking too fast will drag the dog and decrease its mood, but walking too slow will cause it to become angry and tug at the leash. In some scenarios, the player must run quickly on the treadmill in order to "catch" their runaway dog.    The game ends when the chosen route is completed, or when the dog's mood level decreases to zero. After the game ends, the player's score is calculated and the distance walked, amount of movement, and number of calories burned are displayed.</desc>

		<name>Monkey Ball (GDS-0008)</name>
		<desc>Monkey Ball is a Sega NAOMI GD-ROM arcade game, originally released in 2001. It is the first game in the Super Monkey Ball series.    The arcade cabinet of Monkey Ball is unique for its banana-shaped joystick. All the bananas in the game are sponsored by Dole, a practise that would carry through to its successor, Super Monkey Ball and Super Monkey Ball 2. There are three characters, AiAi, MeeMee and Baby, three difficulty levels and numerous puzzles to complete.    Monkey Ball was somewhat unique at the time of release. Though marble/ball rolling games had been done in the past, such as Marble Madness, these types of games are fairly rare, and none had ever been presented in 3D.    Monkey Ball itself was not ported to consoles. Instead, an upgraded version titled Super Monkey Ball was released for the GameCube a few years later. It contains all the levels seen in Monkey Ball, plus enhanced graphics and extra features.</desc>

		<desc>Arle Nadja and her friends take some time off from Puyo fighting and challenge players to dance with them. The game features several dance stages similar to those of Dance Dance Revolution. It also introduces a new ELLENA system used to render the game as well as a new exclusive character featuring the same name (Ellena Stevens, the protagonist of the original Broadway Legend Ellena). One or two players can dance to a variety of J-pop tunes by using the controller buttons to copy their opponent's moves. Based on how well a player copies the moves, Nuisance Puyos are sent to their opponent. The player not having Nuisance Puyos on their side of the screen when the song is over wins the stage.</desc>

		<name>Rhythm Tengoku (Japan)</name>
		<desc>Rhythm Tengoku for arcade is a port of the Gameboy Advance game of the same name.  It's a music game based around good timing and rhythm. The game has music supplied by the record production company J.P. ROOM, and is developed by the team responsible for Wario Ware, which is visible in the quirky presentation of the game.    The game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package. Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions.    Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more.</desc>

Like Samba de Amigo, Shakatyo Tambourine! was followed by an update, Shakatto Tambourine! 2001. In a strange turn of events Shakatto Tambourine! was never brought to a Sega home platform, but was brought to the Sony PlayStation in the form of MiniMoni. Shakatto Tambourine! Dapyon!, complete with tambourine controllers built similarly to the Sega Dreamcast's Samba de Amigo Maracas (provided by Sammy).</desc>

However, the weapon power-up system from Trizeal was removed, replaced by the special fixed-weapon system, with a standard attack and a charged attack that can destroy single large enemies once. The player can choose from one of the four weapon sets during the start, with one mimicking the attack pattern of "XII Stag".    Shmups Skill Test:  A collection of competitive mini-games for shooter fans. A player's proficiency is measured at the end of each mini-game, with both 'Score' and 'Result' displayed, and there are 3 modes in proficiency measurement.</desc>

		<name>Virtua NBA (USA)</name>
		<desc>Virtua NBA presents its basketball action on a 3D court, but it essentially maintains a 2D perspective for most of the viewing, save for its replay sequences. Essentially, it looks like a highly detailed 3D version of NBA Showtime. Because Sega opted to allow only five preselected characters per team, it could focus on making sure those players look very life-like (rather than attempt to bring every NBA player into the game). The players all animate well, and their shadows and reflections look very slick. Other than that, the crowd looks more realistic than any I've ever seen before - go up for a shot and people will actually look up at you. Very well done.</desc>

		<desc>Virtua Striker 2 is a football game. Players compete as 1 of 32 international teams, detailed down to the members' uniforms and playing styles. As the most dedicated soccer fanatic expects, the gameplay is highly detailed and the action is fast and furious. The realistic, motion-captured players perform a plethora of stylish moves, including bicycle kicks, headers, and slide tackles. One cool feature: as the virtual clock ticks away the hours from morning through evening, the environmental lighting adjusts accordingly. Of course, a social game like soccer is twice as fun with a fellow Pelé wannabe, which is why there's a head-to-head two-person multiplayer mode.</desc>

Your wish is granted with Chaos Field!!    The game draws on elements from other shooters to create its own unique hybrid style of play. You'll have a lock-on feature to take enemies and certain bullets out, as well as a "Radiant Silvergun"-style short-range energy field that will absorb certain bullets.    The action plays out in top-down fashion in the time-honored traditions of the shooting genre. Enemies and bullets will swarm like bees to honey, and it will be up to you to destroy everything, while avoiding getting blown up.</desc>

		<name>18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker (deluxe, Rev A)</name>
		<desc>A truck driving game from Sega. Race another trucker across the country, carrying cargo and trying to beat the clock. The main purpose is to make it to the finish line with your cargo within a given time. Players choose one of several trucks, each rated in speed, handling, etc. They then race from point to point across the country, hauling cargo (more difficult cargo will increase your pay for that leg of the journey) while avoiding innocent traffic (blare the horn to get drivers out of your way) and trying to outrun a reckless computer opponent (or player two in linked matches). Good performances are rewarded with bonus stages that require players to maneuver the truck in tight alleyways and park the truck in a limited amount of time.</desc>

Each stage has a range of military themed enemies, including tanks, gunships and other helicopters, as well as an end of level boss. To encourage risky play for high reward, bosses are harder and yield more points when a player has fewer lives left. Once the player has completed the five stages, the game starts a second loop on stage 2-1, a mirrored version of stage 1-1 with an increased difficulty level and altered background. Once stage 2-5 has been completed, the game is over.</desc>
